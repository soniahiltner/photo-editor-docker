# Photo-Editor

Application to edit photos created with react js on the frontend and express js on the backend, using the multer library for uploading files to the server and the sharp library for image processing.

This is a  multi-container application.

Take a look at cloning this repository and start the application with docker compose up.

You can view a live demo [here](https://photo-editor-frontend.onrender.com), but it is very slow and can ran out of memory.
